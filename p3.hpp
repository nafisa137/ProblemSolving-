// One of the criteria for ordering the retrieved documents is how many times a word exists in the document. To find that out, she needs to develop a frequency table for a given text file. A frequency table lists words and the number of times each word appears in a document or a file. Help her write a program that creates a frequency table for a file whose name is entered by the user. Use STL map that stores <Key, Value> pairs of string and int. First, read the input file and clean it of all punctuation and non-alphanumeric characters except "-" which can be part of a word. You may find functions ispunct(), isalnum(), tolower(), etc (see cctype library) useful to use. Test your program on multiple different files.
